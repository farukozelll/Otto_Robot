**Background information:**

Otto DIY robot with fully functioning Arms

@[youtube](https://youtube.com/embed/5jKLDHdLwg4)

‚Äã

this is one of the first iteration of Humanoid, visit the new project here: https://wikifactory.com/+OttoDIY/humanoid

## How it Works


Otto has fully functioning arm movements, this has come with a small price to pay, Some of Otto's mouths have been removed to allow for the additional memory needed for the arms, these include the numbers 5 -9 and the vampire mouths \(sorry\) Also only one animated mouth has been left, the sleeping dreamMouth, again the others have been removed for additional memory, I think the arm movements are worth the sacrifice.

‚Äã

As an open source library, Otto and Myself respect all contributors to the open source community and thank you very much for everyone's supervision.

## List of Parts


* 6 x SG90 SERVOS
* 1 x Arduino NANO atmega328 version
* 1 x Arduino NANO I/O shield
* 1 x HC SR04 ultrasonic module
* 1 x MAX7219 dot matrix module
* 1 x piezo 5volt buzzer
* 12 x Female to female hook-up wires
* 1 x Bluetooth module \(optional\)
* LIPO battery 3.7volt and a suitable DC-DC converter module \(optional\)
* GSTDUINO PCB \(instead of the Arduino Nano and shield, OPTIONAL\)

‚Äã


## 3D Printing


* Recommended to use a FDM 3D printer with PLA material. Settings to Print your Otto Quad,
* 20% infill
* supports for the feet Only as they need to printed as they are provided
* I use a RAFT to help stick to the bed, this is optional
* There should be no need to rotate any parts, print as they are shown.

‚Äã

This is an advanced project so for coding an try the other examples you will need Arduino IDE \(version 1.8.5 preferably to avoid future errors\)

‚Äã


## Assembly Instructions


\(PENDING\) We need volunteers here to contribute please\)

Include step-by-step instructions for creating the project.

Bonus points if you add an assembly video or photos for each step!

Demonstrate workflows used and all the process to make the project.

It's a good idea to include the problems you faced and how you fixed it!

Tips and Tricks. Note any technical parameter that would help a person to replicate your work
